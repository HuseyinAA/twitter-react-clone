# Twitter Clone using React.js, Firebase
This is an React clone made in react.js and firebase. The goal was to learn react and put into practice some of the skills I learnt when watching the LinkedIn react.js tutorials. The Goal was to simply build the home page. This clone is a partial clone with partial functionalities. Twitter is a massive website that has developers around the world. So I had to reduce the size of my scope and focus on something do able that still looks nice and presentable. 

Here is an image during the development of the clone. After playing around I had some issues with sizing . So I had to fix that but other than that everything was coming together.

The second image is the current state of the clone where everything I set out to do is done. I am proud of how it has turned out and I hope to further expand the clone to have multiple sections and components. I also would have like to add timestamps by possibly using moment.js(deals with timestamps) and to be able to order the tweets in order of when they were tweeted.

But for now it is in a acceptable stage.
